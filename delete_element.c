I. Deletion of an element of an array
Write a C program that deletes an element of a 1D array of a specific size at a desired position. 
The size and elements of the array as well as the position of the element to deleted from the array are provided by the user.

Note:
1. Input integers in the follwing order only:
    - size of array
    - elements of array
    - position from where an element needs to be deleted
2. Upon deletion of the element at the specified position, all elements after that position must be shifted one position to the left to fill up the gap.
3. Display output as:
    Array after deletion: <array elements separated by a single space>

Example:
Original array: 6 7 8 9 10
--> delete element at position 2 (element: 8)
Array after deletion: 6 7 9 10
